Compilation of SQL data analysis related projects and challenges where I practice aggregates and joins.
1. Description:
In this challenge, I performed analysis for Songify - a fictional music streaming service. Songify has a “freemium” model, meaning that it offers both a free product and a premium paid product.
I worked with with six tables:
* 		plans
* 		users
* 		premium_users
* 		songs
* 		months
* 		plays

2. Description: 
For this project, I worked with some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site. On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate others’ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.
I was given three tables:
* 		users: users data
* 		posts: posts information
* 		subreddits: information about subreddits

Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.
In this project, I analyzed different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that were given:
